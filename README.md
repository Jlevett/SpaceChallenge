# SpaceChallenge
Final project of Udacity's Object Oriented Programming in Java course

I found the course rushed through some of the harder concepts and there was not enough
exercises and support to get to a competent level to complete this project 
given the basic programming prequistes for the subject.

Its only due to my patience and previous knowledge that I managed to complete it.

I had to reduce some of items weights (found in the text files) so those items could fit in the space craft.
